        <p>My name is Mark Tiapkov, I reside in Seattle, WA. with my partner and currently learning how to code. After pondering a career change for a few years (it's spooky!)

      <p>I have several several hoobies and interests. Particuralry I enjoy spending time <span class="green">outdoors</span>, we've come to discover that Seattle and surrounding areas 
      have <a href="https://www.wta.org/go-outside/seasonal-hikes/winter-destinations/hikes-30-minutes-from-seattle"><strong>plethora of hikes</strong></a> 
      to discover challenge yourself with. Additionally I enjoy reading, usually taking turns reading books in Russian and English (Russian is my first language) to maintain my russian 
      language skills that I don't get to practice too much outside of reading books or talking 
      to my immediate family. I have also been a life long gamer, and while I don't put in the hours I used to, I still play video games on weekly basis. Watching/following sports is 
      another major hobby of mine. Sports include Basketball, MMA, Formula 1, American Football as well few e-sports leagues.</p>
